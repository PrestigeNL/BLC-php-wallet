Modifications of the BLC-PHP-Wallet

For EDU WV. 

Based on bloocoins

MORE INFOMATION:

today i finally setup a live website after alittle over 6 months of contacting people for the backend.

EDU-WV is based around the grand idea of open source following along with education it will be used to buy and sell virtual goods embedded inside of a website. everything will be free in a sense you only buy and sell things with EDU. this allows us to never make nor encourage anyone to pay real money to play the game.

We also understand that this software is under license. In saying that once the website is up i will now allow ads on the website nor anything tha will in any way aquire money. This zero profit as i am here to provide fun to the people of my state. It may not become very big but if we acomplish this all credit still falls open the developers.

Remember all infomation relating to the orignal owners and there rights have been left inside the code.
